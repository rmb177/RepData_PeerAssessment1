# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1



## Loading and preprocessing the data
The zip file containing the activity data was provided with the assignment. My code
assumes the zip file is present in the working directory.

I first create a generator function to process the date format used by the file.


```r
library("lubridate")
setClass('myDate')
setAs("character", "myDate", function(from) as.Date(from, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
```

I then unzip the file and read in the data.

```r
unzip("activity.zip")
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv", 
                         header=TRUE, 
                         colClasses=c("numeric", "myDate", "numeric"), 
                         comment.char="")
```

Finally, I transform the data into formats needed throughout the analysis.

```r
# Sum up the total number of steps for each individual day
stepsByDay <- aggregate(activityData$steps, by=activityData[c("date")], FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

# Sum up the total number of steps for each time interval
stepsByInterval <- aggregate(activityData$steps, by=activityData[c("interval")], FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The first two requirements for the analysis were to provide the following information:

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

The instructions stated to ignore N/A values, which resulted in days with 0 total steps. These days were removed with the following code.


```r
stepsByDayValidObservations <- stepsByDay[stepsByDay[,2] > 0, ]
```

The historgram was generated with the following code. I specified that the histogram show 20 groups to give a more fine-grained view of the step counts:

```r
hist(stepsByDayValidObservations[, 2], 
     breaks=20,
     main="Frequency of Daily Total Step Counts ",
     xlab="Total Steps",
     col="#daf0dd")
```

The mean and median were generated with the following code:

```r
print(paste("Mean number of steps taken per day = ", round(mean(stepsByDayValidObservations[, 2]), 2)))
```

```
## [1] "Mean number of steps taken per day =  10766.19"
```

```r
print(paste("Median number of steps taken per day = ", round(median(stepsByDayValidObservations[, 2], 2))))
```

```
## [1] "Median number of steps taken per day =  10765"
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
The next part of the assignment asks for the following items:

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

Both pieces of information were generated with the following code:

```r
plot(stepsByInterval[, 1], 
     stepsByInterval[, 2], 
     type="l",
     main="Mean Step Count by Interval",
     xlab="Interval",
     ylab="Mean Step Count",
     col="#498dff")
```

![plot of chunk meanStepCountByInterval](figure/meanStepCountByInterval.png) 

```r
maxIndex = which.max(stepsByInterval[, 2])
print(paste("The interval with the maximum average number of steps taken is interval",
            stepsByInterval[maxIndex, 1],
            "with the average number of steps =",
            round(stepsByInterval[maxIndex, 2], 2)))
```

```
## [1] "The interval with the maximum average number of steps taken is interval 835 with the average number of steps = 206.17"
```



## Imputing missing values
The next part of the assignment asked for the following items:

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

The total number of missing values in the dataset was generated by the following code:

```r
print(sum(!is.na(activityData[, 1])))
```

```
## [1] 15264
```

For part two, I decided to use the suggested strategy of replacing NA values with the averages steps for the corresponding interval. To do this, I first created the following function:


```r
lookupAverageStepsForInterval <- function(rowData, lookupTable)
{
    if (is.na(rowData[1]))
    {
        return(lookupTable[lookupTable$interval == as.numeric(rowData[3]), 2])
    }
    else
    {
        return(as.numeric(rowData[1]))
    }
}
```
The function takes in a row of the original dataset and a data matrix of the average steps per interval that serves as a lookup table. If the step value is NA, the function returns the corresponding average for the row's interval value. Otherwise, it returns the original step value.

This function is then used to generate the new dataset and calculate the new total steps per day values:

```r
imputed_data <- data.frame(apply(activityData, 1, lookupAverageStepsForInterval, stepsByInterval), 
                           activityData[, 2], 
                           activityData[, 3])
colnames(imputed_data) <- colnames(activityData)

imputedStepsByDay <- aggregate(imputed_data$steps, by=imputed_data[c("date")], FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The historgram was then generated with the following code:
 
 ```r
 hist(imputedStepsByDay[, 2], 
     breaks=20,
     main="Frequency of Daily Total Step Counts ",
     xlab="Total Steps",
     col="#daf0dd")
 ```
 
 ![plot of chunk imputedStepsPerDayHistogram](figure/imputedStepsPerDayHistogram.png) 

The mean and median were then generated with the following code:

```r
print(paste("Mean number of steps taken per day = ", round(mean(imputedStepsByDay[, 2]), 2)))
```

```
## [1] "Mean number of steps taken per day =  10766.19"
```

```r
print(paste("Median number of steps taken per day = ", round(median(imputedStepsByDay[, 2]), 2)))
```

```
## [1] "Median number of steps taken per day =  10766.19"
```

As you can see, the impact of imputing the missing values was minimal. This makes sense since I replaced missing values with average values.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
